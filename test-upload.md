```powershell
# List all uploaded files
Get-ChildItem uploads\appointments\ | Format-Table Name, Length, LastWriteTime

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: No files received
**Logs show:** `Files received: 0`

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Check field name is `documents` (plural)
2. ‚úÖ Use `form-data` not `x-www-form-urlencoded`
3. ‚úÖ Don't use `Content-Type: application/json` header

---

### Problem: "Field name must be 'documents'"
**Error:** `LIMIT_UNEXPECTED_FILE`

**Solution:**
- Change field name from `document` to `documents`

---

### Problem: File not found in uploads folder
**Logs show:** File uploaded but not in directory

**Solutions:**
```powershell
# Check current directory
Get-Location

# Navigate to project root
cd C:\Users\Mohamed\Desktop\CareFlow

# Check if directory exists
Test-Path uploads\appointments

# Check write permissions
icacls uploads\appointments
```

---

### Problem: "File too large"
**Error:** `FILE_TOO_LARGE`

**Solution:**
- Files must be under 10MB each
- Compress large files or reduce image quality

---

### Problem: "Only PDF, DOC, DOCX, and image files allowed"
**Error:** `UPLOAD_ERROR`

**Solution:**
- Allowed extensions: `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`
- Rename file with correct extension

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Database Verification

Check if file paths are saved in database:

```javascript
// In MongoDB Compass or CLI
db.appointments.findOne({ "document.0": { $exists: true } })

// Should show:
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "document": [
    "uploads/appointments/appointment-1729340123456-123456789.pdf",
    "uploads/appointments/appointment-1729340123456-987654321.jpg"
  ],
  // ... other fields
}
```
