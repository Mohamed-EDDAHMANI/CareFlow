**Access Control**:

- ‚úÖ **Admin**: Users with admin role or administration permission
- ‚ùå **Other Doctors**: Cannot update appointments they're not assigned to
- ‚ùå **Patients**: Cannot update appointment status

---

## Path Parameters

| id | string | Yes | Appointment ID |

---

## Request Body

| Field | Type | Required | Valid Values | Description |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|-------------|

---

## Status Transition Rules

### Valid Transitions

| From Status | To Status | Allowed | Notes |
|------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| scheduled | completed | ‚úÖ Yes | Only if appointment date has passed |
| scheduled | cancelled | ‚úÖ Yes | Any time |
| completed | scheduled | ‚ùå No | Cannot revert completed appointments |
| completed | cancelled | ‚ùå No | Cannot change completed appointments |
| cancelled | scheduled | ‚ùå No | Cannot reactivate cancelled appointments |
| cancelled | completed | ‚ùå No | Cannot change cancelled appointments |

### Business Rules

1. **Completion Rule**: Cannot mark a future appointment as "completed"
   - System checks if appointment start time has passed
   - Error: `INVALID_OPERATION` if trying to complete future appointment

2. **Cancellation Permanence**: Once cancelled, appointments cannot be changed
   - This prevents accidental modifications to historical data
   - Error: `INVALID_OPERATION` if trying to change cancelled appointment

3. **Authorization**: Only assigned doctor or admin can update
   - Error: `FORBIDDEN` if other users try to update

## Frontend Integration

### React Example

```javascript
const updateAppointmentStatus = async (appointmentId, newStatus) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `http://localhost:3000/api/appointments/${appointmentId}/status`,
      {
        method: 'PATCH',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ status: newStatus })
      }
    );

    const data = await response.json();

    if (data.success) {
      alert(`Appointment ${newStatus} successfully`);
      // Refresh appointment list
      fetchAppointments();
    } else {
      alert(`Error: ${data.message}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    alert('Failed to update appointment status');
  }
};

// Usage
<button onClick={() => updateAppointmentStatus('68f123...', 'completed')}>
  Mark as Completed
</button>
```

## Status Icons & Colors (UI Recommendation)

| Status | Icon | Color | Badge |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| scheduled | üìÖ | Blue | `bg-blue-100 text-blue-800` |
| completed | ‚úÖ | Green | `bg-green-100 text-green-800` |
| cancelled | ‚ùå | Red | `bg-red-100 text-red-800` |

---

## Logging

Every status change is logged in the console:

```
‚úÖ Appointment 68f0e8bff5a469392e0343bc status changed from "scheduled" to "completed" by Dr. Smith
```

This helps with:
- Audit trail
- Debugging
- Monitoring appointment workflows

---

## Validation

Request validation uses Joi schema:

```javascript
{
  status: Joi.string()
    .valid('scheduled', 'completed', 'cancelled')
    .required()
}
```

Invalid requests are rejected before reaching the controller.

## Best Practices

### For Doctors:
1. ‚úÖ **Mark completed immediately** after patient consultation
2. ‚úÖ **Cancel early** if unable to attend
3. ‚úÖ **Don't mark future appointments** as completed

### For Admins:
1. ‚úÖ **Verify before changing status** - confirm with doctor/patient
2. ‚úÖ **Use cancellation for no-shows** - mark as cancelled if patient doesn't show up
3. ‚úÖ **Keep audit trail** - log reasons for status changes

### For System:
1. ‚úÖ **Send notifications** when status changes (email/SMS)
2. ‚úÖ **Update patient records** when appointment completed
3. ‚úÖ **Free up slot** when appointment cancelled (allow rebooking)

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Reason for Cancellation**: Add optional `cancellationReason` field
2. **Rescheduling**: Add endpoint to reschedule instead of cancel
3. **No-Show Status**: Add "no_show" status for patients who don't attend
4. **Notification System**: Send email/SMS when status changes
5. **History Tracking**: Keep log of all status changes with timestamps
6. **Batch Operations**: Update multiple appointment statuses at once
